    - stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
    - it is how the internet handles communication between clients and servers, is done by requests and responses.
    - HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser.
        get - should only ever retrieve data
        post - submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server - usually something to be saved
        put - method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload - update everything for a resource
        patch - partially modify a resource - not really used much, post is more common
        delete - delete a resource

    JSON: JavaScript object notation
    - a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntaxp
    - text data but JS is ready to parse it into javascript objects and vice versa
    - When JSON data is sent from a server to a web browser, it is transmitted as a string.
    - This is known as deserializing an object.
    - we can use the global JSON object to parse the string, and turn it into JS objects
    - The JSON object also has a method called stringify(), which converts objects into a string using JSON notation so it can be sent from the browser back to a server. This is also known as serializing an object.

 What is AJAX? What is meant by asynchronous code?
    - stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML
    - Ajax is a technique for loading data into part of a page without having to refresh the entire page.
    - Browsers have a built in XMLHttpRequest object to allow asynchronous requests without reloading the page
    - asynchronous code is meant to allow your code to run in the background while not blocking the execution of the code
    - it enables your program to run while still being able to respomnd to other events while it is running instead of doing it after the task is finished
