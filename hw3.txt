3. Compare and contrast margin, padding, and border.

In comparison, all three are properties that are available to be adjusted to control the appearance or style. If 
the width is specified for a box, then all three properties are added to its width and its height

margin - margins are outside(in constrast to paddings) the edge of the border, and is the gap between the borders of boxes that are next to eachother.
you can set the width of the margin to create a larger gap. The value is commonly in pixels but it can also be used by percentages 
or ems. if one box sits on top of another box then the margins collapse and the larger of the two will be used and the other will be discarded.
unlike borders, margins do not have a color or style.

padding - padding is between the text and border of the box (inside, in contrast to margins). it is the space inside the border and between the text within it, and
increasing the padding can make it easier to read. This padding property as well as the margin property is helpful by adding space between
various text and items on the page which makes it clearer and more organized. The padding property is more specified in pizels but it can also use
percentages or ems. if a percentage is used, then the padding is that percentage of the browser. In terms of color, it inherits the background color. 

border - every box has an invisible border that is specified to be 0px. The border is what separates 
the boxes from one another. You can specify the border style and color.
