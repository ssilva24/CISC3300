    1. What happens from the time a user puts a URL into their browser to when they are able
    to view a webpage? - Briefly define ISP, URL, DNS, web server.  
       When a user puts ina URL into their broswer to view the webpage, it connects to a DNS to find the location
       of the web server. To connect to the web it does so via ISP and contacts DNS.
       ISP - stands for Internet Service Provider, when you connect to the web it is done via ISP
       URL - stands for Uniform Resource Locator, every web page has its own URL. this is the web address
       that is typed into a browser to visit that web page
       DNS - stands for Domain Name System, the computer contacts these network of servers,and act like
       books, telling it the IP address associated with the requested domain name.
       web server - sends the page requested back to the web browser.

    2. What is html? What does it do?
        HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and it is a text and coding language that allows you to design and build websites.
    
    3. Access https://www.fordham.edu/. In your own words, describe how this webpage uses
    structure to convey meaning and navigation options to the user.
        The Fordham Webpage has a banner with the Fordham Logo which makes it clear to the user that they are in their homepage. It has a bar of options that are easy
        for the user to navigate to places. It also has a section for Fordham News which can captivate the users attention. I would say it is very structured, and the theme
        goes along with the Fordham colors, it has a lot of colorful images and different paragraphs on several different places.

    4. What is an html element? Tag? Attribute?
        element - everything inside the opening and closing brackets. Made up of two tags, an opening and closing,
        tag - the name of the element to denote that it is an element. Acts like containers, say something about the info in between the closing and opening tags
        attribute - extra data that tells us more about a particular element, has a name and value.

  	<h1>Hi! My name is Stephanie Silva and this is my simple homepage</h1>
  	<p1>To start off, my name is Stephanie Silva. I am a sophomore at Fordham University, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in New Media and Digital Design. I am currently 19 years old and my birthday is on October 22. 
        I was born here in the US, but both of my parents were born in Lima, Peru. I am a proud Latina, first generation student. I am a commuter, from New Rochelle, Westchester, NY. Interesting fact, I was an Engineering Physics Major during my 
        first semester of college, but decided to switch my major once I saw I enjoyed CS1 way more and felt more comfortable in the field. Ever since then, I have fallen in love with the field more and more each day,
        and I can surely say it is my passion..</p1>

    <h2> My Career Goals</h2>
    <p2> Due to the fact that I love and enjoy coding, I would want to pursue a career in which I can code and create programs. I am not sure if I would like to go into 
        web developing or Software Engineering. I am going more towards Software Engineering, but I have also considered Cybersecurity and am thinking of perhaps pursuing a Masters in Cybersecurity.
